# Web Development Project 5 - *Rick and Morty Characters - Data Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Kelly Chan**

This web app: **lets you easily browse through all the Rick and Morty characters. You can search by name, filter by status or species, and even pick how many episodes a character shows up in. It also shows some quick stats like how many characters there are and status of those characters. Plus, you get to see their pictures and basic info in a simple, clean layout. Itâ€™s a fun way to check out your favorite (or weirdest) characters from the show!**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

## Notes

One of the tricky parts was fetching all the characters from the API since the data comes in pages. I had to set up a loop to keep requesting until I got everything, which took some trial and error. Also, making the filters work together smoothly was a bit challenging, making sure the search, status, species, and episode count all combined properly without bugs. Lastly, styling the dropdowns and inputs to look good took some trial and error, especially to get the spacing and hover effects just right.
